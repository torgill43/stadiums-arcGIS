# Overview
I've been curious about ArcGIS for some time now and felt that I could explore this tool by combining two of my interests: maps and baseball. I love looking at maps and I try to always be the navigator on road trips. I also grew up playing and watching baseball. The data used for this project is composed of various aspects of Major League Baseball (MLB) stadiums, including:
- Stadium name
- Team name
- League the team belongs to
- Stadium capacity
- Stadium coordinates for placing points on the map
